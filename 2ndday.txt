i was not able to answer a question of differntiation and everyone laughed at me
i felt humiliated as it was the only thing i wasw good at
i would never forget this day
i felt like a wirthless person beccoming a fool infront of everyone but still to hide my sadness i smiled 
I Hope tommorow would be a good day
